For the following scenarios we'll present the flags for the Unknown group creation:
	-when creating a new group type map from the GUI which does not have already an unknown group:
		flags: no flag is set
		status: DISCOVERED

	-for CJM collector handler:
		flags: AUTOMATIC
		status: ACTIVE
		-we are using the the unknown logic to link the new hosts with the unknown group

	-for Disk handler:
		an Unknown group is created only for PROJECT_GROUP
			flags: ACTIVE; AUTOMATIC and VRG only if the flags are provided from the xml

	-for Ganglia handler:
		if topology is not available
			for CLUSTER
				flags: AUTOMATIC 
				status: ACTIVE
		if topology is not available or if the grid name is empty
			for GRID
				flags: no flag is set
				status: ACTIVE
		
	-for GPFS handler:
		flags: AUTOMATIC
		status: DISCOVERED

If we receive a parentless group and we have a parent map we will link to Unknown.
If we do not have a create rule or the status that should be used when creating the element, an Unknown group is created.
